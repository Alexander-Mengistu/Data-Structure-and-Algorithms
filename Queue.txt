in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO)

/* Queue is commonly used for scheduling taks, incoming calls, email listing
a queue is a waiting line or lineup of taks, requests, or interactions that are pending
processing or handling, commonly used in contact centers
*/

/*
FIFO principle states that the first element added to the Queue will be the first one to be 
removed or processed. So, Queue is like a linke of people waiting to purchase tickets, where 
the first person in line is the first person served. "First Come First Serve" */

/*
Terminologies of Queue
- "Fron"t: position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called front or the head of the queue.
- "Rear": position is that last in Queue is the recently added
- "Size": refers to the current number of elements in the queue.
- "Capacity": referces to the maximum the number elements queue can hold

Enqueue: add (an item of data awaiting processing) to a queue of such items.

1. Enqueue:
Enqueue operation adds (or stores) an element to the end of the queue.
Steps:
1. Check if the queue is full. if so, return an overflow error and exit
2. If the queue is not full, increment the rear pointer to the next available position
3. Insert the element at the rear.

2. Dequeue:
Dequeue operation removes the element at the front of the queue. The following steps are taken to perform the dequeue operation
1. Check if the queue is empty. If so, return an underflow error.
2. Remove the elment at the front
3. Increment the front pointer to the next element

3. Peak or Front Operation: 
this operaturn returns the element at the front end without removing item

4. Size Operation
this operation returns the numbers of elements present in the queue

5. isEmpty Operation:
This operations returns a boolean value that indicates whether the queue is empty or not

6. isFull Operation:
This operation returns a boolean value that indicates whether the queue is full or not.

Implemention of queue Data Structure 
queue can be implemented using follwoing data structures: 
- Arrays 
- Linked Lists
