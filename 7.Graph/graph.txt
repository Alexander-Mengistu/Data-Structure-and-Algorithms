Graph Algorithms 

Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and anaylze graphs, solving various range of problems like "finding
the shortest path, cycle detection.

Graph Data structure is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. it is useful in fields such as 
social netowrk analysis, recommendation systems, and computer networks. in the field of sports data science, graph data 
structure can be used to analyze and understand dynamics of team performance and players interaction on fields

() = Nodes also knwon as Vertices
-  = lines are know as edges or arc, they connect 2 nodes together.

G = Graph
V = Vertics 
E = Edges

G=(V,E)

Components of Graph Data Structure
Vertices = Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.
Edges = Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labelled/unlabelled.
