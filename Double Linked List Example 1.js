/* Double Single Link is pretty much a parallel of two single link, double single link is two single links that contain the same data in traverse structure, difference is one single link starts from the beginning and second single link will have reverse of the same data in first single link
example, first Single Link A => B => C, Second Single LInk C => B => C, This means that every node has two pointer one pointing backward and another forward, streamlining */
// Double Link allows for traverse of list in both directions
// Single Node has a data, and two pointers
// Benefits are for applications where frequent "Inserticions" and "deletions" are needed
