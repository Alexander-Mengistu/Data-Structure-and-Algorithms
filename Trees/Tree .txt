Tree Data structure

Tree data structure is a hierachical structure that is used to represent and organize data in the form of parent child relationship. The following are some real world situtions which are naturally a Tree
    - Folder structure in an operating systems
    - Tag Structure in an HTML (root tag the as html tag) or XMLT document

Topmost node is called "Root" and nodes below it called "Child Nodes" nodes below it also called child nodes, and thos child nodes can have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.
those child can be refered to as levels, level 1, 2, 3, 4 as hierachical

Terminologies in Tree data Structure 
                                Root
                                 A
                B                              C
         D Parent of I & J             C parent of F, G, H
            D             E              F     G     H
        I       J      K                F, G, H are siblings
        D, I, J are subtree


    - "Parent Node": The node which is an immediate predcessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {B} is the parent node of {D, E}
    - "Child Node": The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Example {D, E}
    - "Topmost": is the first node in tree, must contain exactly one root not
    - "Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf, Node {I,J,K,F,G,H} are the leaf nodes of the tree
    - "Ancestor of a node": any predcessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called ancestors of that node {A, B} are the ancestor nodes of the node {E}
    - "Descendant" a node x is a descendant of another node y if and only if y is an ancestor of XMLT
    - "Sibling": children of the same parent node are called siblings {D,E} are called siblings
    - "Level of node": the count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node  has level 0.
    - "Internal node": a node with at least one child is called internal node.
    - "Neighbour of a node": parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node
    - "Subtree": any node of the tree along with its descendant

Why tree is considered a non-linear data structure?
Teh data in a tree are not stored in a sequntial manner, they are not stored linearly. Instead they are arranged on multiple levels or we can say it is a hierachical structure.
