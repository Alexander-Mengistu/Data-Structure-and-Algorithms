They is many types of data structures to show from, in this file i will be listing advtanges and dissatavtanges

1. Linear Data structures
Pros: Insertation and Deletion: can delete elements from array utilising index, without having to left shift and right shift when data delete such as dynamic data
Cons: Memory waste: if the array is larger or smaller than necessary, it may lead to waste memory
Cons: Will need to know the size of the array.


2.Stack Data Structure 


3.Queue Data Structure


4.Linked List Data Structure


5.Graph data Structure
