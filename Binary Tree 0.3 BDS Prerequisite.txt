Learning Recursion is must first to learn BDS

Recursion is a function that calls it function till a condition is meat, and step by step returns to the end

recursion can be replaced by loops achieve the same result as recursion. Recursion can sometimes be replaced by an iterative loop toimprove efficiency
code below shows how loops can replace recursion

Recursion code 
  function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }

Iterative factorial Function (Using a loop)
  function factorial(n) {
    let result = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      result *= i;
    }
    return result;
  }

you may be wondering if loops are efficent, why use recursion yes recusion might not be as complex as iterative, recusion is a tool
they is a time and place to use them for example if recursive structure is in use such as "Tree traversal, or fibonacci numbers, divide and conquer algorithms"

Loops Benefits
  - Memory efficiency: each recusive call adds a new frame to the call stack. If recursion goes too deep 
  (especially for large input values), it can lead to "stack overflow". loops dont't have this issue because they reuse the same frame, making them more memory efficient.

  - Performance: Recursion can be slower than loops in some langages, especially if the langauge doesnt optimize tail recursion. Loops,
  on the other hand, are generally faster because they avoid the overhead of function calls and the creation of new stack frames

When Recursion is preferred
  - The problem has a naturally recursive structure (tree traversal, fibonacci number, divide and conquer algorithms)
  - The Algorithm involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems

Yes, loops can do what recursion does, but recursion is often more inutive for problems that inlvovles heirachical or repetitive structures.
